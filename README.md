# Optimization
Ported Matlab version of Optimization library to Python. This is the code I have written as a Research Aide at Argonne National Laboratory from September 2020 - December 2020. The current code may have updates from other users. The point of this repository is meant for a portfolio of my work. For full library, please contact Stefan Wild at wild [at] anl [dot] gov .
