# Optimization
* Ported Matlab version of Optimization library to Python. This is the code I have written as a Research Aide at Argonne National Laboratory from September 2020 - December 2020. Since then, the current code may have updates from other users. The point of this repository is meant for a portfolio of my work. This library does not reflect the newest version and will not be updated. For full library, please contact Stefan Wild at Berkeley Lab @ the time of writing.
* Some of the Python scripts require .mat files that are not saved on this repository.
